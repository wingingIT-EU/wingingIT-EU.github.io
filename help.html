<h2>Rules</h2>
<h3><b>Game goals</b></h3>
<p>This is a game for 3 or more players. Each player except the spies gets a card with a word, which is the same for everyone. The spies get a special card. Nobody knows who are the spies and who are the common folk.</p>

<h3><b>Spy's goal:</b></h3>
<p>To stay undetected, until the time expires, or to guess the word</p>

<h3><b>Other players' goal:</b></h3>
<p>To guess who the spy or spies are.</p>
<p>If one of the players thinks that he/she has detected a spy, participants start voting. If all players who are not spies vote for one person, that person is out. In this case, he/she tries to guess he word. If they guesses correctly and they are the spy, that spy/spies win the game. Otherwise the common folk win. If the player is not a spy, or if there are more spies, the game continues and the person voted out must stay silent.</p>

<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>1. Chose your settings: number of players, number of spies and dictionary</p>
<p>2. Press play</p>
<p>3. Press 'View Card' to view your card</p>
<p>4. Press 'Hide Card' to hide your card and pass the phone/computer to the person beside you</p>
<p>5. Repeat 3 and 4 until all players have seen their card
<p>6. Set a timer ( Recommended: between 5 and 15 minutes or 2 minutes multiplied by the number of players )
<p>7. If the timer has expired, players must have one last vote and eliminate one person. 
<p>8. If there are any spies still playing, the spies win, but if the common folk have managed to vote out all the spies, the common folk win.  

<p><b>Have fun!</b><p>
